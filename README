Greetings!
This repo contains a sentiment analysis model deployed on web. 
The Sentiment folder contains the saved model data. You may create this data using the command: model.save('file name') in your editor and create a fresh file.
The test.py file is just for illustrating, how to access the saved model and doesn't contribute in any way to our final product.
The backnd file contains our flask code which must run.
The template folder contains the html file.
Hope you like this project!
